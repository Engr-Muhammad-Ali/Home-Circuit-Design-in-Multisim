# Home-Circuit-Design-in-Multisim

This is the first complex engineering problem I did after studying the course of Circuit Analysis-I and understanding the basics of voltage, current, resistance and power terminologies. Here, I designed a basic home circuit keeping in mind the input voltage and power of appliances in the household. This project helped me understand the basics of circuit analysis.
